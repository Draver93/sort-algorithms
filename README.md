# Sorting Algorithms Playground

This repository is a learning-focused project aimed at understanding and comparing different sorting algorithms in C++. The goal is to analyze their efficiency, execution time, and implementation details.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are included in this project:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **STL Sort (std::sort for comparison)**

## Performance Benchmarking

The program runs each sorting algorithm on a dataset of 100,000 randomly generated integers and measures execution time in milliseconds. This helps in understanding the efficiency of each algorithm in practical scenarios.

### Sample Execution Results:

| Sorting Algorithm | Execution Time (ms) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort | 12489 |
| Insertion Sort | 883 |
| Selection Sort | 3249 |
| Merge Sort | 1545 |
| Quick Sort | 6 |
| Heap Sort | 8 |
| STL Sort | 6 |

## How to Run the Code in Visual Studio

1. Clone the repository:
